# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTOR

A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using logistic features such as class, sex, age, fare, and family relationships.

##  OVERVIEW:
This project includes:
- A trained **Random Forest** model using the Kaggle Titanic dataset
- A clean and responsive **Streamlit web app** for live predictions
- Custom feature engineering (e.g., Family Size, Title, IsAlone)

##  GOAL OF PROJECT:
To demonstrate applied knowledge of machine learning, data preprocessing, and UI development using Python.

##  MODEL:
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest
- **Accuracy**: ~83% (local cross-validation)
- **Features**: Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarked, FamilySize, IsAlone, Title
